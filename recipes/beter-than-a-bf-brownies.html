      These "Better than a Boyfriend Brownies" are whipped up in one bowl and are so easy even kids can make them. I am pretty sure I could make these brownies in my sleep. I've tried more brownie recipes than I would like to admit but all of that practice has made me a brownie connoisseur of sorts, right? This is hands down the BEST homemade brownie recipe.
