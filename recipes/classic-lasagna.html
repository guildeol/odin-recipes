      This is one recipe my husband begs me to make. He is obsessed with this lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! There's something so amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna.  Whenever he orders beef lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm, comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 small Onion (finely diced)</li>
      <li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon Garlic Powder (or 5 garlic cloves, finely minced)</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Pepper</li>
      <li>32-40 ounce jar Marinara Sauce (may use more depending on how "saucy" you want it)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
      </li>

      <li>
        Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer.
