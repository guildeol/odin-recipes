      The first time I made them, I was shocked because they were crunchy and sweet and chewy and had the best buttery caramel flavor. These Caramel Corn Cookies are out of this world!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup Butter (softened)</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>1 Egg Yolk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>2 ⅓ cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>4 to 6 * cups Caramel Corn (see notes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes. scrape the sides of the bowl, halfway through the time to ensure even mixing. This helps to give the butter time to coat the sugar crystals to create a smooth and creamy cookie texture</li>
      <li>Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and mix for 1 minute longer.</li>
      <li>Fold in flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add in 4 cups of caramel corn and mix for about 30 seconds to 1 minute to help break up some of the caramel corn into smaller pieces.</li>
      <li>Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line light-colored baking sheets with parchment paper. Drop cookie dough onto baking sheet and make sure to spread them apart in case of spreading.</li>
      <li>Top each cookie dough ball with a few caramel corns. Bake at 350 degrees for 11-14 minutes.</li>
      <li>When you remove them from the oven, if the cookies have spread, take a spatula and carefully press the edges of the cookie towards the center to shape it into a circle. To make the cookies look extra gourmet, add a few more caramel corn balls on top of the cookies. For an extra salty-sweet cookie, sprinkle with sea salt flakes.</li>
